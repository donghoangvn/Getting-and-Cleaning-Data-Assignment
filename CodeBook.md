##Description of variables
##The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.
##These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:
##'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

##The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are:
##mean(): Mean value
##std(): Standard deviation
##activities: variable of experiments
##subjects
##values in row are averages of variables for the subject and the activity
